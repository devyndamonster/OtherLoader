# OtherLoader
#### A whole new loader!

OtherLoader is an asset loader for H3VR, which functions similarly to other loaders like LSIIC.

#### Why should you use OtherLoader?
- It supports custom ammo
- It supports custom item spawner categories
- It allows modded items to use Deli's dependany system
- It doesn't spam the console like LSIIC

## Manual Installation
1. Install [Stratum](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/Stratum/Stratum/)
2. Extract the OtherLoader `.zip` file into the BepInEx plugins folder

## Using legacy mods with OtherLoader
Legacy mods (mods loaded with LSIIC) can be loaded by placing the virtual object files into the `H3VR/LegacyVirtualObjects` folder
